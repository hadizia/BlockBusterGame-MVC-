# BlockBusterGame-MVC-
A block buster game with the ability to create profiles, change game settings and storing high scores in a leaderboard. We utilized the MVC pattern and used technologies such as java2d and other geometric libraries for the calculation of bounce points. There was also a persistence layer to keep the data backed up.
